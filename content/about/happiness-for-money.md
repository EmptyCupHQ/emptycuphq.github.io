title: Happiness for money
---

Most of us nod to ourselves when we hear that happiness is more important than money. But, often we end up violating that very obvious principle in very profound ways. When understood and inculcated honestly, that one principle can completely change the course of life for the better.

If happiness is more important than money, can we get happiness by paying money? Ofcourse, the obvious way to buy happiness is by spending money to acquire something that can make us happy.
