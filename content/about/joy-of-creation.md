title: Joy of Creation
---


When you're developing a software, you get to see the evolution of the software from nothing. As you work patiently to implement new features, the software slowly starts becoming more and more capable. This discovery of capability is very empowering for any developer. That __sense of empowerment__ is the _joy of creation_.


When you labour for hours on a painting, you get to see that each brush stroke, seemingly inconsequential by itself, slowly captures beauty on that empty canvas. This vision of beauty is very fulfilling for any painter. That __feeling of fulfilliment__ is the _joy of creation_.


When you try to write a compelling story, you get to see the story slowly unravel from a kernel of truth at the centre of it. This evolution of truth is very profound for any writer. That __profound realisation of truth__ is the _joy of creation_.


When you pour the best of yourself into a piece of art, you get to see strangers moved by it. This invisible connection is very gratifying for any artist. That __bond of gratitude__ is the _joy of creation_.


The creative process, when pursued consciously, is a source of immense joy. 


### Why it matters...

If we lose sight of the joy of creation, we can't sustain the effort for creation. Developers get burnt out, painters get bored, writers just churn out words and artists decay.

To make matters worse, the joy of creation is quite elusive. It takes a lot of sacrifice and commitment to experience the joy of creation.


#### What that means...

At EmptyCup, we commit to ourselves that:

- We are doing this for ourselves. Not for users, not for shareholders, not for the industry. But we believe that if we pursue our own joy of creation honestly, we'll inevitably create value for users, shareholders and the industry.
- We will not let ourselves do things just for money or just for fame or just for our ego. We'll ask ourselves everyday: "Can I feel the joy of creation today?"
- We will also go to immense trouble to enable someone else also experience that joy of creation.
