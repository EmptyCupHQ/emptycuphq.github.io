Learning by building is the best way to learn because:

1. Knowing why you need to learn makes learning interesting.
2. You only learn what matters to get the job done.
3. When you try to apply what you learn, you understand it better. 
4. The satisfaction of building something justifies the effort for learning it.


<br>

So:

1. If you want to learn something, just start building something with it.
2. Try building something and you'll automatically learn a lot.

<br>

A few examples:

1. Instead of studying the textbook on DBMS, setup a MySQL server, import some data and try running some meaningful queries.
2. Instead of doing a course on python, write a script that crawls a website for images.
3. Instead of studying cloud computing textbooks, deploy a webapp on  a public cloud.
4. Instead of deciding what technologies to learn, build something interesting and learn whatever is needed to make it happen.
