### About the product:

EmptyCup 3D is an online web based SaaS software for interior designers. It enables users to create floorplans in top view 2D. The 3D model of the house is automatically generated from this 2D design. Then the users can customise materials and lighting in 3D. Once the design is complete, users can export photorealistic renders from anywhere in the house.

### About the culture:

EmptyCup believes that having rich life experiences is essential to spur creativity and keep passion burning strong. To break the monotonous work life, the company will be organising an outing once every 2 months. The outings planned this year are trekking in the western ghats, a weekend beach retreat and stay at a buddhist monastery.

EmptyCup adopts an open culture true to its name. Even as an intern you will be allowed access to all the company’s activities like marketing, hiring, design, customer engagment, social media, planning and finances as long as you fulfill your direct primary responsibilities satisfactorily.

EmptyCup believes leisure is as important to sustain creativity as intense practice. Our minds relax, recharge and build entropy during leisure that inspires and fuels our intense creative pursuit. As such, EmptyCup encourages leisure by organising talks, binge watch off days, book readings and weekend challenges.

### Application process

There will be no interviews or coding tests. [EmptyCup believes interviews are a bad test for good talent](https://emptycuphq.medium.com/guerilla-hiring-62a912c57eb6). 

To apply for the internship, you have to first register using [this google form](https://forms.gle/a2NjvXYAN1YQRugm9). Then, you have to complete [a take home assignment](/academy/assignment). You can join [EmptyCup's slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/emptycupacademy/shared_invite/zt-256nm43bn-BNQb_UeEn3mI2QrnjMJ9GA) for any questions and support for the assignment. Though the mentors cannot help you directly with code, they can guide you on the development process with resources and pointers. 

The deadline for the assignment submission is **December 1st @ 6.00am**. After the assignment deadline, there will be a code review with a mentor where the mentor will walk through your code with you on call. Based on the mentor's feedback, you will receive an offer from EmptyCup for the internship position.

Everyone who completes the assignment, regardless of selection, will receive a Certificate of Accomplishment from EmptyCup and can use the reference in their resume.
