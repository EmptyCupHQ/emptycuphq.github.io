__Why do we fall asleep during some lectures or when reading textbooks?__

Simple answer is that they are boring. If something is boring, you'll probably not do it wholeheartedly. If you're not doing something wholeheartedly, you'll probably not be very good at it because deepdown you don't care and you'll give up sooner or later. So, it is very important to make sure your learning process is not boring.

__How can you make sure your learning process is not boring?__

Learning becomes boring when your mind is not willing to take in more information. Your mind finds it draining to remember detailed information, especially if it can't see an immediate need for that information.

So, stop trying to load information into your mind. Stop thinking of your mind as a hard disk and start thinking of it as a CPU / processor. Processors don't hold information. Whenever they need to process something, they fetch the information from wherever it is on the hard disk and use it to compute something. Today, you have the internet and google search that is atleast 10,000x better than your mind at storing and retrieving information. So, stop trying to remember anything.

__But, what is the point of learning if we don't remember anything?__

It is very useful to think of learning something as solving a puzzle. The puzzle is to develop a mental model of how that something works. So, you search for the information that gives you a basic idea. You try that solution. If that doesn't solve the puzzle, you see where you got it wrong and try to solve that by getting a little more information. This is the true essence of learning. 

> Have you ever seen anyone fall asleep while solving a puzzle?

Ironically, this process also maximizes your ability to digest information because you are actively seeking that information. It is not being forced into you in a top down fashion.

Remember, you don't read a gadget's manual from beginning to end. You try to use the gadget, get stuck and then check the manual for how to use it properly. That is how it works with all technology.

__What does this mean practically when learning to code?__

1. Don't try to remember commands. Just bookmark the link.
2. Don't try to read documentation from starting to end.
3. Don't try to read the textbook chapter on databases to setup a MySQL instance.
4. Don't make study plans. Textbooks are predictable. Real world is not.

Those are the don'ts. Some do's:

1. If you read a stack overflow answer and it doesn't make sense, read the 3 lines slowly, again and again till you understand the words atleast. Once you understand, you can judge whether it is relavent for you or not.
2. If you find terms that you don't understand, open a new tab and google them. It will take some time, but slowly you'll know enough terminology that you don't have to google so often. This is the best way to learn terminology. Think of this like using a dictionary, not reading a textbook from beginning to end.
3. Always read as little as possible. You have a limited storage space in your mind and your mind will give up if you feed it unnecessary information. You yawn and get sleepy, lose interest and give up if you force your mind.
4. Your puzzle is unique. We all understand concepts in our own way. Keep googling for the pieces to your puzzle. Don't expect someone else to give you a solution.

__The most important thing is to keep yourself hungry to learn more.__

__Remember, learning is supposed to be interesting. If it is not, you're not doing it right.__
