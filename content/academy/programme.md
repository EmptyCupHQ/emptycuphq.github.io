There is a sharp skew in the current software developer job market. There is strong demand for software developers. But the expectations are also high. So, most companies look for developers with 2-4 years experience because freshers, though talented, lack experience and skill with real world technologies.

EmptyCup Academy aims to bridge this gap by introducing industry challenges to engineering students early on and cultivating a pool of high impact fresh hires who are ready to deliver from the get go.

As a student, this gives you a 2-4 year head start in your career path which is a huge advantage in the corporate setting. For EmptyCup, this is an opportunity to groom talent and hire confidently instead of hiring blindly with 2-3 rounds of interview and investing huge amount of time and money in training on the job.


# How it works:

The program is divided into 3 phases:

- [Phase 1: Learning the basics](#phase-1-learning-the-basics)
- [Phase 2: Contributing to open source](#phase-2-contributing-to-open-source)
- [Phase 3: Internship](#phase-3-paid-full-time-internships)

### Phase 1: Learning the basics

The entire program emphasises on learning by doing. To complete this phase and proceed to the next, you have to successfully submit a pull request. You will have to make a contribution  to [our repository of developer notes](https://emptycuphq.github.io/notes/). 

In this phase, you will:

- Learn how to setup SSH to GitHub, fork a repo, clone, commit, rebase, push and submit a pull request.
- Learn how to setup a clean development environment on your personal machine.
- And, hopefully, something new that you can contribute.

Some notes:

- Though some resources may be provided, you will have to learn on your own through the internet. If you’re stuck, [check this out.](https://emptycuphq.github.io/notes/stuck/)
- There is no time limit. But, whoever completes this phase will immediately proceed to the next phase.
- [Developer notes](https://emptycuphq.github.io/notes/) was setup just for you to learn by contributing. All the content is free and open sourced for everyone. Hopefully, the next person after you can skip your struggle and learn from your contribution.

### Phase 2: Contributing to open source

Once you are familiar with the contribution workflow, you can start working on EmptyCup’s open source project Portfolio. Portfolio is a portal that connects interior designers and home owners. It lets designers build and showcase their portfolio and homeowners to post their requirements and find the right designer.

The highlight of Portfolio is that it is conceived as a domain agnostic solution. That means it can be used to setup a portal for yoga instructors or packers & movers or cooks or veterinarians or stage performers or stylists. The project is open sourced owing to its wide application.

Typically in open source, the entire project is not built by one person or one team. It is a collaborative effort where the entire project is broken down into smaller tickets (or issues or tasks) and each contributor picks up the ticket that they are interested in and submits a pull request. 

In the same way, Portfolio will also have an issue tracker on GitHub containing tickets that explain the problem to be solved and an approach to implement the solution. Each ticket will also have tags indicating the difficulty level, technologies to be used, rough estimate of time needed. You can pickup tickets based your interest. Each ticket can be discussed with mentors in the ticket’s comment section.

In this phase, you will learn:

- How to design and develop a backend REST API.
- How to design and develop a modern web interface.
- How to deploy a containerised app on the cloud.
- How to setup, manage & migrate a database.

If you complete this phase, your code will be actively used by thousands of people.

More details will be provided on completing Phase 1.

### Phase 3: Paid full time internships

Students successfully completing Phase 3 are eligible for semester long full time paid internship. Unlike typical internships where more than half the internship period is wasted in just getting up to speed. Internships from this program will be high intensity as you will already have a deep context on the work and a strong rapport with your mentor. 

A full time position will be offered for every internship. The salary package may be expected to be the best in the industry.

# Expectations:

- This is a collaboration, not a competition. There is no restriction on the number of students finishing each phase. The goal is not to filter students, but to enable as many to finish the program as possible. So, help your friends and take help from them. Learn together.
- Practically, there is no limit on the number of internships available as there are other companies and startups eager to offer internships to students who have a track record. They will be formally announced after Phase 3 based on the response.
- Don’t expect the tasks to be straightforward. Don’t expect clear steps to solve the issue every time. If you are not able to solve something, that means you don’t know enough yet. So, focus on learning and understanding. Keep trying, don’t give up. There are no deadlines. You fail only when you give up.
- Be respectful of mentorship time. As full time developers ourselves, time is the most costly resource for us. Learn as much as you can through googling. Ask your friends. Ask for help online. But, do ask us for help if you still can’t figure it out. There is no point to the program if you get stuck and give up.
- All communication will be asynchronous. That means everyone will get back to you on their own schedule, not yours. This doesn’t mean you are less important. It means that they have to manage their own time efficiently. Expect email responses to take 1-2 days at least. Have back up plans and communicate early if you must.
- Expect each phase to last one semester. You need that time to learn something thoroughly. Doing things fast may seem glamorous, but may not be sustainable in the long run. Be consistent and pay attention to the details. That is how you build stamina.
